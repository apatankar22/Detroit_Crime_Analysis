    "For centuries, outer space has been considered to be one of the great unknowns of civilization- specifically, the different objects that exist. Of those objects, stars are one of the most researched cosmic bodies, and tend to be classified in a specific manner. The classification of stars in galaxies is dependent on a variety of a factors which qualify a star to fall into a certain category. There are many different classifications that are used to categorize stars, and they are called spectral classes/types. \n",
    "\n",
    "The classification of stars in these \"classes\" also corresponds to a diagram known as the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram, which represents the absolute magnitudes of stars plotted against all spectral types/classes. The spectral classes are in order of descending temperatures- O, B, A, F, G, K, M [1]. This would indicate that an O-type star would be the most hot and bright, while a M-type is the coolest and dimmest. [2]\n",

    "The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram is a graph that has evolved from its original creation by Danish astronmer Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell [2]. This diagram ranks the brightness and spectral type against the temperature of the stars in the universe. is shown above [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this encoding of stars with respect to their temperatures, cooler stars have a whiter appearance, with hotter stars represented as warmer and more orange. As shown in the diagram above, the main categories of star naming are Red Dwarf, Brown Dwarf, White Dwarf, Main Sequence, Super Giants, and Hyper Giants. Brown dwarfs are a category of stars called substellar objects, and are smaller than white and red dwarfs, as these are the stars which don't reach nuclear fusion, i.e. they don't \"ignite\" [4]. White dwarfs are one of the conclusions of a star's life cycle, they are lower in magnitude. Red dwarfs are larger than brown and white dwarfs, they are the largest \"dwarf\" stars. Main sequence stars make up around 90% of the universe's stars; the end of their life cycles means they leave the main sequence, and become white dwarfs [4]. Finally, super and hyper giants are the biggest stars in the universe- hypergiants tend to be larger than super giants. Both star types do not become white dwarfs; and they \"die off\" by exploding as supernovae. \n",

    "The challenge of the features we currently have are that they are likely highly correlated and depend on one another. Additionally, some of the the true accuracy of the measures might have been beyond what we can currently attain. For this reason, we propose that all variables will contribute equally to a certain degree, and that we will not need to use a complex model to estimate a star's type."

    "#### Temperature in Kelvins\n",
    "The **Kelvin scale** is a temperature scale that is frequently used in astronomy. Astronomers need another scale so they can write numbers in a more convenient manner. The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales are set up specifically for the numbers to be reasonable for Earth's temperatures, but in space, they are much hotter or much colder. Additionally, there are no negative numbers in the Kelvin scale, rendering it easy to write very cold temperatures. -391 degrees Fahrenheit would translate to 38 Kelvins. To introduce some perspective into our dataset, the Sun's core is about 15 million Kelvins (27 degrees Fahrenheit).\n",
    "#### Luminosity\n",
    "**Luminosity** is the amount of electromagnetic energy emitted per unit of time by a star, and it is measured in joules per second, or watts. In astronomy, luminosity is typically indicated in terms of the average luminosity of the Sun, $L_o$. This differs from **brightness** in that brightness is a measure of appearance that takes into account both the luminosity, the distance from the viewer, and the absorption of light along the path to the observer. Stellar luminosity depends on both the size (represented in terms of $R_o$, and the temperature in kelvins. Most of the time, neither can be directly measured. To measure a star's radius, we use the **angular diameter** and its distance from Earth (**stellar parallax**). The visualization for angular diameter computation is shown below, where $\\delta=2arctan(\\frac{d}{2D})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Angular diameter](imgs/Angular_dia_formula.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, a star's luminosity is measured with its apparent brightness and distance.\n",
    "#### Absolute Magnitude\n",
    "**Magnitude** is a measure of brightness of a star. Stars are assigned to magnitude classes, with the lowest number class being the brightest. The scale for magnitude is logarithmic. Each step of one magnitude changes the brightness by a factor of the fifth root of 100, so a magnitude one star is approximately 100 times brighter than a magnitude six star. The magnitude is measured either absolutely or apparently. Apparent magnitude is the magnitude of a celestial object as it appears in the night sky. The absolute magnitude is represented in terms of what the magnitude the object it would be if it were placed 10 parsecs (1 parsec ~= 3.26 light-years ~= 30.9 trillion km) away from Earth. We use the measure of the absolute magnitude in our dataset. The Sun has an apparent magnitude of -27."

    "The dataset in use for this specific project belongs to NASA and is readily provided on Kaggle. It is publicly available and anyone could use the data for their own analysis, hence we are eligible to have such access to the data we are using in this project. Considering the credibility of NASA as a company, we believe that the data being used in this project is transparent. The variables that are being measured such as temperature and luminosity are objective and since it doesn't involve any individual in particular, data privacy is not that much of an issue. With that laid out, our intent is to come up with an objective analysis with ethics and privacy concerned from as many angles possible.\n",

Unfortunately, it was not indicated on how far off these values are. If these data are strictly used for experimental purposes, then we trust that these measurements are recorded with the utmost precision. "
